In fields of green where wildflowers sway,  
A world unfolds where rabbits play,  
Their cotton tails, a fluffy sight,  
Bounding with joy, from morn till night.  
  
Eyes so bright, a curious gaze,  
Innocence woven through their maze,  
Silent whispers of nature's delight,  
In this gentle realm, they find respite.  
  
Their fur, a canvas of colors galore,  
From snowy white to brown galore,  
Graceful hoppers, nimble and swift,  
Navigating the meadow's intricate drift.  
  
Oh, gentle rabbits, creatures of grace,  
Explorers of a hidden space,  
Beneath the moon, their secret dance,  
As stars above their rhythms enhance.  
  
They nibble on clover, fresh and sweet,  
With nimble jaws, each blade they meet,  
Foraging through the verdant fields,  
Their hunger satisfied, nature's yield.  
  
Burrows carved into the earth's embrace,  
A sanctuary, their sacred place,  
Safe from predators that roam,  
Where generations find a home.  
  
Soft as whispers, their love they share,  
Nuzzling noses, a tender affair,  
In their world, a family thrives,  
A testament to life's precious ties.
