## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
And the mome raths outgrabe.  
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both   
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright -  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  
      
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In fields of green where wildflowers sway,  
A world unfolds where rabbits play,  
Their cotton tails, a fluffy sight,  
Bounding with joy, from morn till night.  
  
Eyes so bright, a curious gaze,  
Innocence woven through their maze,  
Silent whispers of nature's delight,  
In this gentle realm, they find respite.  
  
Their fur, a canvas of colors galore,  
From snowy white to brown galore,  
Graceful hoppers, nimble and swift,  
Navigating the meadow's intricate drift.  
  
Oh, gentle rabbits, creatures of grace,  
Explorers of a hidden space,  
Beneath the moon, their secret dance,  
As stars above their rhythms enhance.  
  
They nibble on clover, fresh and sweet,  
With nimble jaws, each blade they meet,  
Foraging through the verdant fields,  
Their hunger satisfied, nature's yield.  
  
Burrows carved into the earth's embrace,  
A sanctuary, their sacred place,  
Safe from predators that roam,  
Where generations find a home.  
  
Soft as whispers, their love they share,  
Nuzzling noses, a tender affair,  
In their world, a family thrives,  
A testament to life's precious ties.
